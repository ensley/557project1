# STAT 557, Project 1

The aim of this project is to practice linear classification methods and QDA and study basic
techniques of dimension reduction.

1. Apply LDA, QDA and logistic regression to your dataset and compare them.
2. Study whether dimension reduction improves classification. You can use principle components,
a certain feature selection procedure, etc.
3. You are encouraged but not required to use cross-validation to evaluate your classification
algorithm. If you decide not to use cross-validation, you can divide the data randomly into a
training set and a testing set.
4. Write a report. In the report, you are required to explain the contribution of each individual
group member.
